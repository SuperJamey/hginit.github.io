title: Setting up for a Team
description: >
  One of the benefits of using Mercurial is working
  with a team on the same code. Mercurial lets you
  each work independently, and merges your changes together.

<p>The most common way to collaborate with Mercurial is to set up a central repository, in addition to the private repositories that we each have on our own computers. We can use the central repository sort of like a swap meet, where we get together to trade the changes we’ve been making.</p>


<div><img src="i/02-repo.png" /></div>

{% include cheat.html 
   top=0 
   command="hg serve" 
   text="runs a web server to make the current repository accessible over the Internet"
%}

<p>The quick-and-dirty way to make a central repository is to use Mercurial’s built in web server&#8212;all you have to do is make a repository with <strong>hg init</strong> and then serve it on the web with <strong>hg serve</strong>. By default it will be served on port 8000.</p>

<pre><samp>
<span class="prompt">C:\> </span><kbd>mkdir CentralRepo</kbd>

<span class="prompt">C:\> </span><kbd>cd CentralRepo</kbd>

<span class="prompt">C:\CentralRepo> </span><kbd>init</kbd>

<span class="prompt">C:\CentralRepo> </span><kbd>serve</kbd>
</samp></pre>


<p>Since this computer is named <strong>joel.example.com</strong> I can just go to <strong>http://joel.example.com:8000/</strong> with a web browser and see that the server is up and running, even though the repository there is completely empty.</p>


<div><img src="i/02-web.png" /></div>

{% include cheat.html 
   command="hg clone"
   text="make a complete copy of an entire repository"
%}

<p>With the central web server running, I can <em>clone</em> this repository <em>from</em> the server <em>onto</em> my own computer for my own use. This repository is empty right now, so I’ll just get another empty repository when I clone it.</p>

<p>Notice that when I committed that time, I used the <strong>-m</strong> argument, which I haven’t done before. That’s just a way to provide the commit message on the command line, without using an editor.</p>

<p>OK, where are we? So far, I’ve got a central repository, and my clone of it. I’ve made two changes and committed them, but those changes are only in my clone&#8212;they’re not in the central repository yet. So the world looks like this:</p>


   <div><img src="i/02-repo-2.png" /></div>

{% include cheat.html 
   command="hg push"
   text="push new changes from this repository into another"
%}


<p>Now I’m going to use the <strong>hg push</strong> command, which will push my changes from my repository into the central repository:</p>

<p>Oh great. It figures that wouldn’t work. I neglected to think about the security implications of just running a random web server and allowing anybody in the world to push their stupid changes into it. Bear with me for a moment; I’m going to configure that server to allow anybody in the world to do anything they want to it. This can be done by editing the file .hg\hgrc on the server:</p>
<div class="edit1">
                <div class="edittopbefore">
                .hg\hgrc </div>
                <div class="editcontent">
                    [web]<br />
                    push_ssl=False<br />
                    allow_push=*<br />
                </div>
                <img src="i/edit-bot.gif" width="387" height="76" />
    </div>

 <div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Needless to say, this is rather unsafe, but if you’re on a nice protected LAN at work and there’s a good firewall and you trust everybody on your LAN, this is reasonably OK. Otherwise, you’ll want to read the advanced chapters on security.</p>

<p>OK, time to fire up the server again:</p>

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\CentralRepo></span> <kbd>hg serve</kbd>
</samp></pre>


<p>And now I should be able to push into it:</p>

<p>Yay! Now the world looks like this:</p>


   <img src="i/02-repo-3.png" />

<p>I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, &#8220;Gosh, Joel, that’s strange. Why do these repositories contain <em>changes</em> as opposed to <em>files</em>? Where’s that <strong>guac</strong> file?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s weird. But that’s the way distributed version control works. Repositories just contain big stacks of changes. Imagine that a change is like one of those clear transparency sheets. When you have a bunch of transparency sheets, you stack them on each other in order, with the latest change on the top, and look down from above, and&#8212;tada!&#8212;you’re looking at the current version of the file. As you peel away transparencies from the top of the pile, you see older and older versions.</p>

<p>We can use our web browser to peek into the central repository now:</p>


  <img src="i/02-web-2.png" />


<p>Exactly what you would expect.</p>

<p>Now I want Rose to help me work on the recipe. Rose is on the test team. Everyone agrees that she reminds them of those middle-aged ladies you see in Vegas, sitting there slack-jawed for hours, shoveling quarter after quarter into the slot machines, only she’s testing software. You can throw her a new version of your code and she’ll test it on 23 different Linux distros, one after the other, expressionless, unmoving, pausing only to tell you that there’s a dot missing on one of the lower-case I’s in the Turkish version on Ubuntu Linux. Rose is a great tester but I swear sometimes she acts like a zombie.</p>

<p>Rose can continue to work, disconnected, making as many changes as she wants, and either committing them, or reverting them, in her own repository. At some point, though, she’s going to want to share all the changes she’s been committing with the outside world. She can type <strong>hg outgoing</strong> which will show a list of changes that are waiting to be sent up to the central repository. These are the changes that <strong>hg push</strong> would send, if she were to <strong>hg push</strong>.</p>

<p>The reason Rose’s push succeeded while mine failed is because potato chips do not go well with guacamole. Just kidding! I wanted to see if you were awake, there.</p>

<p>The push failed because we both made changes, and so they need to be merged somehow, and Mercurial knows it.</p>

<p>The first thing I’m going to do is get all those changes that are in the central repository that I don’t have yet, so I can merge them.</p>

<p>Look! The <strong>hg merge</strong> command took my two heads and combined them together. In this case, since we both edited different parts of the file, there was no conflict at all and the merge went off without a hitch.</p>

{% include cheat.html 
   command="hg merge"
   top="-65"
   text="merge two heads"
%}

<p>I still have to commit. This is important. If the merge failed, I could always revert and try again. Since the merge was successful, I’m going to commit it. Then I’ll be able to push my changes to the central repository.</p>

<p>And now the central repository has the same thing as I do:</p>


<img src="i/02-repo-7.png" />


<p>OK, I have Rose’s changes, and my changes, but Rose doesn’t have my changes yet.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot to tell you about Rose. She’s a doctor. Yep. A medical doctor. Isn’t that weird? She was a hotshot pediatrician at Mt. Sinai, probably earning five times as much as this crappy joint pays its testers. Nobody really knows why she left the field of medicine. The other testers think something tragic happened. She had a family, once, too; there’s a picture of a cute ten year old on her desk, but now she lives alone, and we don’t want to pry.</p>

<p>Rose needs to
pull the latest, incoming stuff from the repository to get it.</p>

<p>Got it. Now, you may find this a bit odd, but even though Rose pulled those new changes into her repository, <em>they’re not in her working directory yet.</em></p>

<p>See that? She’s still working with Tortilla chips. Tortilla chips!</p>

<p>They’re just not in her working directory. That’s because she’s still working off of changeset #2. You can see this with the “parent” command:</p>

<p>Mercurial is being nice to us. It’s always safe to pull; all it does is get us the latest changes that other people have been making. We can switch to working with them later, at our own convenience.<p>

<p>Remember that the <strong>hg up</strong> command with no arguments will change the working directory to the <em>tip</em> (the absolute TOP changeset), in this case number 4:</p>

<p>And now, she’s looking at the latest version with everybody’s changes.</p>

<p>When you’re working on a team, your workflow is going to look a lot like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you haven’t done so in a while, get the latest version that everyone else is
      working off of:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>hg pull</li>
      <li>hg up</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Make some changes</li>
  <li>Commit them (locally)</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 2-3 until you’ve got some nice code that you’re willing to inflict on everyone else</li>
  <li>When you’re ready to share:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>hg pull to get everyone else’s changes (if there are any)</li>
    <li>hg merge to merge them into yours</li>
    <li>test! to make sure the merge didn’t screw anything up</li>
    <li>hg commit (the merge)</li>
    <li>hg push</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h2>Test yourself</h2>

<p>Here are the things you should know how to do after reading this tutorial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up a central repository and let team members clone off of it</li>
  <li>Push changes into the central repository</li>
  <li>Pull changes from the central repository</li>
  <li>Merge changes from different contributors</li>
</li>
</ol>
