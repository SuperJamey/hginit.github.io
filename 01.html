   Even if youâ€™re working by yourself, you should use Mercurial
   to get the benefits of version control. This tutorial shows
   how easy it is to check a directory into Mercurial so you
   can track old versions easily.

  <p>
    Mercurial is a <em>version control system</em>. Developers use it to manage source code.
    It serves two important purposes:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>It keeps track of every old version of every file</li>
    <li>It can merge different versions of your code, so that teammates can work independently on the code and then merge their changes</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Without Mercurial, you could try to keep old versions
  just by making a lot of copies of the directory containing all your code:</p>
  <div class="i">
    <img src="i/01-copies.png">
  </div>
  <p>This is tedious, takes up a lot of disk space, and confusing. Using version control is a better way to do this.</p>
  <p>Most people work with Mercurial through the command line, which works on Windows, Unix, and Mac. The command for Mercurial is <strong>hg</strong>:
  </p>
  <div class="codesnippet">
    <div class="codetop"> </div>
                                <pre>
c:\hginit&gt; <strong>hg</strong>
Mercurial Distributed SCM
basic commands:
add        add the specified files on the next commit
annotate   show changeset information by line for each file
clone      make a copy of an existing repository
commit     commit the specified files or all outstanding changes
diff       diff repository (or selected files)
export     dump the header and diffs for one or more changesets
forget     forget the specified files on the next commit
init       create a new repository in the given directory
log        show revision history of entire repository or files
merge      merge working directory with another revision
pull       pull changes from the specified source
push       push changes to the specified destination
remove     remove the specified files on the next commit
serve      export the repository via HTTP
status     show changed files in the working directory
summary    summarize working directory state
update     update working directory
use "hg help" for the full list of commands or "hg -v" for details
    </pre>
    <div class="codebottom"> </div>
  </div>
  <p>Typing <strong>hg</strong> without anything else gives you a list of the most common commands that are available. You can also try <strong>hg help</strong> for a complete list of commands.</p>
  <p>To take advantage of version control, you needed a <em>repository</em>. A repository stores all your old versions of every file. To save disk space, it&#8217;s not actually going to store every old version&#8212;it&#8217;s just going to store a compact list of changes.</p>
  <p>In the old days, getting a repository was a big deal. You had to have a central server somewhere and you had to install software on it. Mercurial is <em>distributed</em>, so you can use it without a fancy central server. You can run it entirely on your own computer. And getting a repository is super-easy: you just go into the top-level directory where all your code lives&#8230;</p>

  <p>That&#8217;s the repository! It&#8217;s a directory full of everything Mercurial needs. Settings, old version of files, tags, an extra pair of socks for when it rains, etc. <em>Don&#8217;t go in there.</em> You are almost never going to want to mess with that directory directly.</p>
  <p>OK, now that we have a fresh new repository, we&#8217;re going to want to add all these source files to it. That&#8217;s easy, too: just type <strong>hg add</strong>.</p>

  <p>There&#8217;s still one more step&#8230; you have to <em>commit</em> your changes. What changes? The change of adding all those files.</p>
  <p>Why do you have to commit? With Mercurial, committing says &#8220;hey, the way the files look right now&#8212;please remember that.&#8221; It&#8217;s like making a copy of the whole directory&#8230; every time you have something that you&#8217;ve changed that you sorta like, you commit.</p>

  <p>In the days before Mercurial, this would be a good opportunity to go crying
    to the system administrator and asking piercingly sad questions about
    <em>why</em> the backup system is &#8220;temporarily&#8221; out of commission and has been
  for the last eight months.</p>
  <p>The system administrator, whom everybody calls Taco, is too shy to eat lunch
    with the rest of the team. On those rare occasions where he is away from his swivel office
    chair, you will notice a triangular-shaped salsa-colored stain on the seat where
    drippings of his many Mexican lunches fell between his legs, insuring that nobody takes
    his chair, even though it is the superior Herman Miller variety that the company founders bought
    themselves, not the standard-issue Staples $99 special that causes everyone else
  back pain.</p>
  <p>Anyway, yeah, there&#8217;s no backup.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Mercurial, though, when you&#8217;re unhappy with your changes, you can just issue
    the handy command <strong>hg revert</strong> which will immediately revert
  your directory back to the way it was at the time of the last commit.</p>

  <p>I used the command line argument <strong><code>--</code>all</strong> because I wanted
  to revert <em>all</em> files back to their original state.</p>
  <p>So, when you&#8217;re working on source code with Mercurial:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make some changes</li>
    <li>See if they work</li>
    <li>If they do, <strong>commit</strong> them</li>
    <li>If they don&#8217;t, <strong>revert</strong> them</li>
    <li>GOTO 1</li>

  <p>As time goes on, you may get confused about where you are and what
    changes you&#8217;ve made since the last commit. Mercurial keeps
    track of all that for you. All you have to do is type <strong>hg status</strong> and
  Mercurial will give you a list of files that have changed.</p>

    Now. That missing file, favicon.ico. As earlier, if you didn&#8217;t mean to
    delete it, you can <strong>hg revert</strong>, but let&#8217;s assume you really did mean
    to remove it. Whenever you remove (or add) a file, you have to tell Mercurial:
  </p>
  <div class="codesnippet">
    <div class="codetop"> </div>
    <pre>
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg remove favicon.ico</strong>
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg status</strong>
M a.txt
R favicon.ico
? b.txt
    </pre>
    <div class="codebottom"> </div>
  </div>
  <p>The &#8220;R&#8221; means &#8220;Removed&#8221; so the next time we commit in Mercurial this file will be
    removed. (The <em>history</em> of the file will remain in the repository, so of course
  we can always get it back). Finally, we need to add that new file, <strong>b.txt</strong>:</p>
  <div class="codesnippet">
    <div class="codetop"> </div>
    <pre>
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg add</strong>
adding b.txt
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg st</strong>
M a.txt
A b.txt
R favicon.ico
    </pre>
    <div class="codebottom"> </div>
  </div>
  <p>&#8220;A&#8221; means &#8220;Added.&#8221; Did you notice I was getting lazy about typing out
    <strong>hg status</strong> all the time? Mercurial only needs enough letters
  to disambiguate, and there are no other commands that start with <strong>st</strong>.</p>
  <p>Having solved all the little ?&#8217;s and !&#8217;s, I can go ahead and check in my changes:</p>

<p>One more thing about the output from
  <strong>hg log</strong>: the <em>changeset</em> line shows us a number
  to every commit&#8230;. actually two numbers: a handy, short one, like &#8220;0&#8221; for
  your initial revision, etc., and a long, goofy hexadecimal one which you can
ignore for now.</p>
<p>Remember that Mercurial keeps, in the repository, enough information
to reconstruct any old version of any file.</p>

  <img src="i/cheatbot.png" width="241" height="41" />
</div>
<p>First of all, the simple command <strong>hg cat</strong> can be used to print any old version
of a file. For example, to see what a.txt looks like now:</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
  <div class="codetop"> </div>
  <pre>
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg cat a.txt</strong>
SCOTT ADAMS: Civilians believe that if it isn't
broken, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it
isn't broken, it doesn't have enough features yet.
  </pre>
  <div class="codebottom"> </div>
</div>
<p>To see what it looked like in the past, I can just pick a changeset number
  from the log. Then I use the <strong>cat</strong> command
with the <strong>-r</strong> (&#8220;revision&#8221;) argument:</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
  <div class="codetop"> </div>
  <pre>
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg cat -r 0 a.txt</strong>
Scott Adams: Normal people believe that if it ain't
broke, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it
ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet.
  </pre>
  <div class="codebottom"> </div>
</div>
<p>If the file is long and complicated, and only a little bit of it changed,
  I can use the <strong>hg diff</strong> command with an <strong>-r</strong>
  argument to print the difference between any two revisions. For example, to see
what changed between revisions 0 and 1:</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
  <div class="codetop"> </div>
  <pre>
c:\hginit\CountDown&gt; <strong>hg diff -r 0:1 a.txt</strong>
diff -r da5f372c3901 -r a9497f468dc3 a.txt

<p>Finally, if you haven&#8217;t collapsed yet from exhaustion, before
  I finish this tutorial, I just want to show you <em>one more tiny thing:</em> you can use
  the <strong>hg update</strong> command to go backwards or forwards in time
  to any revision you want. Well, you can&#8217;t really go into the
  future <em>per se</em>, although that would be super-cool. If you only had four revisions
  you would just <strong>hg update -r 103994</strong> and get some really
  cool anti-gravity sci-fi futuristic version of your source code.
But of course, that is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>hg update</strong> is actually modifying every file in the directory that changed
  to go backwards and forwards through time. If a file was added or removed, it adds or removes it.
Without any arguments, <strong>hg update</strong> goes to the latest version.</p>
<h2>Test yourself</h2>
<p>OK! That&#8217;s it for tutorial one. Here&#8217;s all the things you should know how to do now:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a repository</li>
  <li>Add and remove files in a repository</li>
  <li>After making changes, see what uncommitted changes you made, then</li>
  <li>&#8230; commit if you like them,</li>
  <li>&#8230; or revert if you don&#8217;t.</li>
  <li>See old versions of files, or even move your directory backwards and forwards in time</li>
</ol>
