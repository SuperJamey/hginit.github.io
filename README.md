# [hginit.github.io](https://hginit.github.io)

This is the original hginit.com website by [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). This is like an archival mirror of the original, since hginit.com is no longer up. Source code was fetched using the Wayback Machine, converted to a minimal Jekyll website, and published via GitHub Pages.

The copyright situation is confusing, but I'd love to get this on the original website (hginit.com).

# Changes from original
